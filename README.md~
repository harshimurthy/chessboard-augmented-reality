# chessboard-augmented-reality
Code to calibrate the laptop camera and the video camera provided . Place spheres at the corner of chessboards and place a teapot at the center of the chessboard


#Requirements:

OpenCV library
OpenGL library
cmake
video/webcam
chessboard pattern

#Description:

<b>camera_calibration folder</b> calibrates the web cam by taking a set of pictures as input and displaying the calibration values
CMakeLists.txt : contains library and this is what is invoked when user calls cmake .
VID5.xml : contains image locations(take images from your camera and place it in a folder and include path as mentioned in the folder)
in_VID5.xml : initialize the file and calls VID5.xml
main.cpp: main program which does all the calibration and displays intrinsic parameters to the console.
out_camera_data.xml : file where all the parameters are stored

procedure to run
include all the above files along with the images in a folder
in terminal:
cd (to the directory where the contents are present)
cmake .
make
./main in_VID5.xml

<b>video_calibration folder</b> calibrates the video by taking a set of pictures as input and displaying the calibration values
CMakeLists.txt : contains library and this is what is invoked when user calls cmake .
VID5.xml : contains image locations(as present in the folder)
in_VID5.xml : initialize the file and calls VID5.xml
main.cpp: main program which does all the calibration and displays intrinsic parameters to the console.
out_camera_data.xml : file where all the parameters are stored

procedure to run
include all the above files in a folder
in terminal:
cd (to the directory where the contents are present)
cmake .
make
./main in_VID5.xml
Camera_calibration

<b>chessboard pattern folder</b> detects the chessboard locations and places solid spheres at each corner when s is pressed and shows a teapot at the center of the chessboard when t is pressed

cam.txt: values after running the camera_calibration main.cpp has to be stored here
input.txt: values after running the camera_calibration main.cpp has to be stored here
checkerboard.avi : video which can be used as a input in the terminal while running the program
CMakeLists.txt : contains library links and executables link
opencv_gl.cpp: program that perfoms the above mentioned operation

procedure to run webcam chessboard
include all the above files in a folder
in terminal:
cd (to the directory where the contents are present)
cmake .
make
./opencv_gl

(this switches on the camera. when the user shows a chessboard to the camera and presses S, the program places solid sphere at the corners and shows teapot at the center when t is pressed)

procedure to run video chessboard
include all the above files in a folder
in terminal:
cd (to the directory where the contents are present)
cmake .
make
./opencv_gl checkerboard.avi

(this displays the video. when the user  presses S, the program places solid sphere at the corners and shows teapot at the center when t is pressed)
